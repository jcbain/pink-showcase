    description = "I am a Computational Anthropologist currently disguised in Biology department as Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Calgary in <a target='_blank' href='https://yeamanlab.weebly.com/' class='link'>Sam Yeaman's lab</a>. I made the trek from the Midwestern United States to Canadadian Rockies to design and build a visualization atlas of complex evolutionary phenomena (biological and otherwise). As a researcher, I am interested in how city composition, human interaction and geography can influence peoples' behaviors and perceptions of others. I am also keen on understanding how the social sciences can leverage machine learning and computation to help answer these questions about human behavior. </br>If I am not in front of my computer then I can often be found in one of few situations: in the mountains with my wife and the pups, cooking or fermenting foodstuffs, or watching The Office, Gilmore Girls or anything from the Bachelor franchise. Doodling has also made its way back into my post-PhD life."
