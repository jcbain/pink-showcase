title= "About Me"
+++

I'm a U.S. transplate in Calgary, Alberta, where I currently hold a Postdoctoral Associate position in the Department of Biological Sciences. I work alongside Sam Yeaman and am in the process of developing a visualization-forward application designed to education academics and others about evolutionary phenomena. In other words, I am just an Anthropologist nestled alongside a bright group of Biologists.

I earned my PhD in Anthropology from the University of Missouri, where I melded my technological interest in building neural networks with my conceptual interest in understanding human conflict and cooperation, primarily through the lens of city composition and response to settling migrant populations.

I'm also an avid dog person and pasta maker. Hiking and reading are also pretty nice.
