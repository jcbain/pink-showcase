It may seem odd that a post about blueberries is my allegorical "maiden voyage" back into blogging. After all of this time has passed; I've earned a PhD, moved Canada, watched Gilmore Girls all the way through...twice, all before writing a single post about anything. I've even designed and built a sparkly new website (seriously, have you hovered over the clouds?) specifically for the occasion and I decide to christen the moment with a post about fermentation and blueberries. But here's the thing, this is a blog about things I do and things I find interesting, and while neural networks and anthropology will certainly be sprinkled heavily throughout, fermenting blueberries is more than just fermenting blueberries; it is piece of rebecoming me.

Being in grad school was mentally taxing. Anyone close to the field probably has a story or two about a time when they or someone they knew was pacing the hall in nothing but a wolf t-shirt questioning whether shipping off to LA and working three serving jobs and a bartending gig whilst aspiring to be an actor was a more viable career path^[I've yet to find the answer.]. There was a long time there where the only things that really made me happy were my wife, my dogs and theme to The Office. But then something amazing happened. I successfully defended my PhD and got a job an hour away from the Canadian Rockies. The two things I had been wanting for the past 5 years had magically happened. In the matter of three months, I could finally be hiking on a weekly basis and I was done with school for the first time since I was singing "I love you" to Barney. For those of you whom I met along the way, I hope it goes without saying that my time in grad school wasn't all bad. I made some really good friends and I really do enjoy my research
