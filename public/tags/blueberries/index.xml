      <description>It may seem odd that a post about blueberries is my allegorical &amp;ldquo;maiden voyage&amp;rdquo; back into blogging. After all of this time has passed; I&amp;rsquo;ve earned a PhD, moved Canada, watched Gilmore Girls all the way through&amp;hellip;twice, all before writing a single post about anything. I&amp;rsquo;ve even designed and built a sparkly new website (seriously, have you hovered over the clouds?) specifically for the occasion and I decide to christen the moment with a post about fermentation and blueberries.</description>
