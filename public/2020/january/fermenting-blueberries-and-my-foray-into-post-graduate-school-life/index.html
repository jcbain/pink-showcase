    <p>It may seem odd that a post about blueberries is my allegorical &ldquo;maiden voyage&rdquo; back into blogging. After all of this time has passed; I&rsquo;ve earned a PhD, moved Canada, watched Gilmore Girls all the way through&hellip;twice, all before writing a single post about anything. I&rsquo;ve even designed and built a sparkly new website (seriously, have you hovered over the clouds?) specifically for the occasion and I decide to christen the moment with a post about fermentation and blueberries. But here&rsquo;s the thing, this is a blog about things I do and things I find interesting, and while neural networks and anthropology will certainly be sprinkled heavily throughout, fermenting blueberries is more than just fermenting blueberries; it is piece of rebecoming me.</p>

<p>Being in grad school was mentally taxing. Anyone close to the field probably has a story or two about a time when they or someone they knew was pacing the hall in nothing but a wolf t-shirt questioning whether shipping off to LA and working three serving jobs and a bartending gig whilst aspiring to be an actor was a more viable career path<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:I-ve-yet-to-find"><a href="#fn:I-ve-yet-to-find">1</a></sup>. There was a long time there where the only things that really made me happy were my wife, my dogs and theme to The Office. But then something amazing happened. I successfully defended my PhD and got a job an hour away from the Canadian Rockies. The two things I had been wanting for the past 5 years had magically happened. In the matter of three months, I could finally be hiking on a weekly basis and I was done with school for the first time since I was singing &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; to Barney. For those of you whom I met along the way, I hope it goes without saying that my time in grad school wasn&rsquo;t all bad. I made some really good friends and I really do enjoy my research</p>
