           <p>It was neaaring the 11 o&rsquo;clock hour and Jennifer and I had just made it to the border crossing at Sweet Grass, Montana. We were spending our Fourth of July being cross-examined by Candadian border agents who had the sense of humor of whole wheat bread.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s an Anthropologist planning on doing in a Biology lab?&rdquo; &ldquo;Fair question, but shouldn&rsquo;t that be determined by the academic institution that had hired me&rdquo;, I thought to myself. Verbally, I had revised my answer to something more tactful (in connotation, not articulation) throwing out buzzwords like &ldquo;data&rdquo; and &ldquo;computation&rdquo; that could convince Canada that I was bringing them someting of value. An hour and a half later, my wife and I were making our way through the rolling prairies of Alberta as Canada&rsquo;s newest residents.</p>

<p>For three years, we had been wanting to move to the mountains, wherever that meant. For a year and half of those three years, I had been actively rummaging through job opportunities that could take us there despite it not being &ldquo;the right time&rdquo;. I was finishing a PhD, which was simulataneously the reason why we couldn&rsquo;t leave along with the reason for which I very much eager to. Others can attest to the unscratchable itch that is anxiety during those years trying to prove yourself a formidable academic. When the time eventually was &ldquo;right&rdquo;, I was certain that my life was about to swerve completely into industry. Academia didn&rsquo;t seem to fit my personality wel</p>

<p>I am a <em>shameful</em>-self-promoter.</p>
